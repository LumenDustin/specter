# SPECTER - AI Image Generation Prompts (DALL-E)

Use these prompts in ChatGPT/DALL-E to generate evidence images for each case.

**Style Notes:**
- All images should have a dark, mysterious aesthetic
- Documents should look aged, worn, or official
- Use muted colors with hints of red/amber for paranormal elements
- Aim for 1024x1024 or 1792x1024 (landscape for documents)
