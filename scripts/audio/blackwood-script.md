### [0:15-0:30] Entering

*[SFX: Footsteps echoing, distant creaking]*

### [0:30-0:45] Patient Ward
**CHEN:** Found the old patient ward. Beds still here, rusted to hell. This is where they kept them. Hundreds of people.

*[SFX: Growing static, electrical interference]*

**YOUNG FEMALE VOICE:** *(clear, emotionless)* Forty-one point four zero three two north. Two point one seven four three west.

**CHEN:** Did you guys hear that? She just said coordinates. I'm writing this down...

*[SFX: Static fades]*

### [1:40-2:00] Building Dread
**CHEN:** This is insane. The EMF reader is going crazy. Temperature just dropped like twenty degrees. I need to find the source of—

*[SFX: Heavy distortion, audio warping]*

### [2:00-2:20] The Possession
**CHEN'S POSSESSED VOICE:** *(overlapping with static, Chen's voice but wrong)* They buried us in the garden. Mother is still waiting.

**CHEN:** I didn't say that. I didn't— What is happening to me?!

*[SFX: Intense static, garbled voices, chaos]*

### [2:20-2:30] Ending
*[SFX: Everything cuts to dead silence]*

*[2 seconds of silence]*
